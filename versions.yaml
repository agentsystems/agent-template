# AgentSystems Version Management
#
# This file controls which versions are latest and visible in discovery.
# Update this file when you publish new versions.

# Latest version (must match an existing {version}.yaml file)
latest_version: "0.1.0"

# Versions visible in discovery (each must match an existing {version}.yaml file)
listed_versions:
  - "0.1.0"

# Example: When you release v0.2.0
# 1. Create 0.2.0.yaml
# 2. Update this file:
#    latest_version: "0.2.0"
#    listed_versions:
#      - "0.1.0"    # Keep old version listed if users might want it
#      - "0.2.0"    # New version
#
# To hide old versions from discovery, remove them from listed_versions:
#    listed_versions:
#      - "0.2.0"    # Only show latest
